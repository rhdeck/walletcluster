# ts-template

## Usage (for now)

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `yarn`
3. Run `yarn run` with arguments of your target addresses. use flags -s for starting block and -e for ending block (defaults to looking at full chain)

Note that this runs without an API key, so we throttle the requests to make sure they all go.
